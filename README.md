**Protection for JX2 .pak Files**
- Custom Encryption Wrapper
- Encrypt .pak files using AES-256 or ChaCha20.
- Use a unique key per server or build version.
- Store keys securely in a compiled binary or obfuscated config file.
- Header Obfuscation
- Modify the .pak file header to break compatibility with standard unpackers.
- Add dummy bytes, reorder sections, or use a custom magic number.
- Checksum & Integrity Verification
- Embed SHA-256 or HMAC checksums inside the encrypted .pak.
- Validate at runtime before loading assets reject if tampered.
- Loader-Level Decryption
- Build a custom game loader that decrypts .pak files in memory.
- Avoid writing decrypted files to disk stream directly to engine.
- Anti-Dump & Anti-Hook Measures
- Detect common unpacking tools (e.g., QuickBMS, Process Hacker).
- Use runtime checks to block memory dumps or DLL injection.
